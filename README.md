# STD Trend Envelopes ReadMe

## Introduction
This code is for the STD Trend Envelopes indicator developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. It is a custom indicator that calculates the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and the upper and lower envelope boundaries based on a given time period.

## Input Parameters
- TimePeriod: Number of periods to calculate the EMA.
- UpperEnvelopePercentage: Percentage above the EMA for the upper envelope boundary.
- LowerEnvelopePercentage: Percentage below the EMA for the lower envelope boundary.

## Global Variables
- EMA: Array to store the values of EMA.
- UpperEnvelope: Array to store the values of the upper envelope boundary.
- LowerEnvelope: Array to store the values of the lower envelope boundary.
- signal: Signal variable: 1 for entry, -1 for exit, 0 for no signal.

## Initialization
In the OnInit() function, the code calculates the EMA by iterating over the bars and summing the closing prices for the specified time period, and then dividing it by the time period to get the average. It also calculates the upper and lower envelope boundaries by multiplying the EMA with the specified percentage.

## Iteration
In the OnCalculate() function, the code checks for entry and exit signals by comparing the closing price with the upper and lower envelope boundaries. If the closing price is above the upper envelope boundary and there is no previous entry signal, an entry signal is generated. If the closing price is below the lower envelope boundary and there is a previous entry signal, an exit signal is generated. If none of these conditions are met, there is no signal.
